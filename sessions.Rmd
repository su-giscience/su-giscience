### Help us communicate

Please talk about our R group with your colleagues. 

You can also print [this poster](Poster 2020-2021.pdf) and put it up somewhere at work.

### Join our R working sessions in Grenoble

We organise monthly working sessions on thursdays at 5PM, at the [IMAG building](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/members.html)). **Due to COVID-19 restrictions all sessions to come and until further notice will be held by ZOOM**.

Please find the guidelines for these sessions:
    
- Everyone is welcome (beginners to advanced R users, just bring your laptop).

- Presentations/tutorials will last 30 to 60 min, on some R topics that can be useful to many people, with practical examples.

- We want to have a lightning talk (5 min) after the main session so that people can quickly present how they use R in their work (or a specific package, etc.).

- During the second part of the session, people could ask and answer some questions about specific problems they encounter when coding in R.

- If you wish to share your R experience during a working session and/or to co-animate a working session, please [contact us](mailto:matthieu.rolland@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

  "Package {exams} enables creating questionnaires that combine program output, graphs, etc in an automatised and dynamic fashion. They may be exported in many different formats: html, pdf, nops and most intresting xml. Xml is compatible with moodle which allows to reproducibly generate random questions in R and create a great number of different exams and make them an online moodle exam.",

  "Package {WDI} enables exploring 40 different datasets hosted by the World Bank. The database World Development Indicators (‘WDI’) contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups. For many series, data goes back more than 50 years. The package is very useful to explore the development of the countries. We will download and plot data together during this session.",

  "RStudio is the most widely used IDE designed to optimize the workflow with R language. However, there exists many alternatives designed for more specific use cases. Among the most popular, there are VS-Code, Jupyter, Atom and many others. What are the advantages they offer? Can they be more useful than RStudio?",

In this tutorial we will learn the underlying philosophy behind {ggplot2}: the Grammar of Graphics. We will see how all types of graphs such as histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, probability densities etc. can be specified by a small set of shared parameters, and how understanding what these parameters are and how to use them will allow you to seamlessly produce powerful and complex graphs to better understand your data.",

  "29/04/2021", "Data manipulation with packages {dplyr} and {data.table}",
  "Data manipulation is an essential step in any data analysis project. Core package of the tidyverse environment, {dplyr} provides a data manipulation framework that uses an intuitive syntax defined by a small set of verbs. In this tutorial we will learn how to pick observations by their values (filter()), reorder the rows (arrange()), pick variables by their name (select()), create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()), collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()) and combine all these operations using the '%>%' (pipe) operator. This will help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges. **ADD data.table**",
